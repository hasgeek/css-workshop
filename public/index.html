          The modern web developer is contantly learning. 
          With the mainstream adoption of CSS3, the availability of quality 
          frameworks, and better tooling for developers, a lot of options have 
          opened up for greater aesthetic expression. Come to this 2 day workshop 
          and learn about the CSS landscape, the new additions to the language, 
          tools and frameworks, and how to develop professional web pages.
