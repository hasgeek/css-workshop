CSS for the Soul
----------------

Install dependencies 
```
npm install
```

Then run the app
```
npm start
```

The content for this microsite has been written in [jade](http://jade-lang.com) and [less](http://lesscss.org). Layout and partials can be found under `views`. 

To generate the site, run 
```
npm run-script pages
```

This generates `public/index.html`. Thus the `public` folder can be directly served.
